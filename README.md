# Product
History Jig-zzle is a modified version of ‘Jigsaw Puzzle’ [1] 2d game with an additional aspect of
being educational. It is projected to be historically accurate game with focus on history and
learning. It will help the players to exercise their brain and also learn something.
It will have at least three levels of difficulty to support age disparity in people. The game will
provide scoring to the player based on his/her performance in each level of the game. The game will
have a timer to time the player. This will also add a sense of competition in the game. The player
will be more interested in the game. Because the aim of the game is to make the player learn
something, so even if the player fails to clear the level, he/she will be shown relative historical
information/facts.

# Scope
Our objective is to create an educational and interactive game in Unity [2], a well-known game
development platform. In this puzzle game, players will not only be entertained but also be able to
learn (educated) about different historical events. We are hopeful to complete this project by the end
of the current semester.<br /><br />
The project will be developed in phases:<br />
● First phase is related to planning and elaborating the functionalities and requirements.<br />
● Second phase is confined to designing and implementation.<br />
● Third phase includes integration and various testing techniques.<br />
Each phase has a deliverable which will be really helpful and act as a measure of progress achieved
so far in the project for the stakeholders interested. The deliverables will be timely and accurate.<br />
There are certain issues/risks associated with our project. As described below:
● There will be issues in development as not all the group members are familiar with Unity
and game development.<br />
● Timely deliveries can be affected because of lack of knowledge in the field of game
development.<br />
● Collaboration issues and risks can really affect the working of our project.<br />
